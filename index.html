        <h1>Hello Digital World!</h1>
        <h3>This is my first try on a website layout.</h3>
        <h4>
            Honestly, I have no idea what to put here at first. So I just googled the first thing that's on my mind.
            <br>
            Here's a picture of a cat and a short story made by chatGPT.
        </h4>
        <p>
            The <strong>friendly gray tabby</strong> was looking towards the person in the snow with bright green eyes full of curiosity and excitement. Its soft fur was lightly dusted with snowflakes, adding to its already adorable appearance. The tabby's body was slightly curved in a friendly manner, as if it were trying to approach the person and say hello. Its tail was flicking back and forth, a sure sign of its playful nature. The person couldn't help but smile at the sight of the cute cat, and they reached out a hand to pet it. The tabby purred happily at the attention, leaning into the person's touch.

            As the person continued to pet the gray tabby, it closed its eyes in contentment, its purring becoming louder and more pronounced. The person couldn't help but laugh at the cute cat's reaction, and they continued to scratch behind its ears and under its chin. The tabby seemed to be in pure bliss, enjoying the affection and attention it was receiving. It was clear that this was a friendly and loving cat, and it was a joy to be around. The person couldn't wait to spend more time with the adorable gray tabby, and they knew that it would be a cherished companion for years to come.

            <strong>Hey, still here? Have some bonus trivia!</strong>
            <br>
            In order to make a gray tabby, you need to have the right genes for the striped pattern (<em>agouti gene</em>), and the right genes for the gray color (<em>dilution and extension genes</em>).
