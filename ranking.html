        Some of the most common cat breeds in the world are:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Domestic Shorthair</li>
        <li>Persian</li>
        <li>Maine Coon</li>
        <li>Siamese</li>
        <li>Scottish Fold</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's worth noting that "Domestic Shorthair" is a catch-all category that includes any domestic cat that is not a purebred. Many people choose Domestic Shorthairs as pets because they are often more affordable than purebred cats and they can come in a wide range of coat patterns and colors.
